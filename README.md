### How to Use

1. **Step 1 - Pic Keywords**: Enter comma-separated keywords (e.g., programminglanguageicons, python, javascript).
   
2. **Display Keywords**: Enter display names for images (e.g., Top 5 Programming Languages, Python, JavaScript).

3. Click the **Download Images** button to download images based on the provided keywords.

4. Click the **Make Video** button to assemble the downloaded images into a video.

5. Optionally, check the **TitleBar** and click **Text on Video** to add a title bar and text overlays.

6. By the end of the process, the video will be saved in the `done/` folder with the title based on the first display keyword (e.g., Top 5 Programming Languages).

Note: Each keyword searches for images related to that keyword.

### Note

I know this could have been a one-click video maker button. This was just a beginner curiosity project, and I'm glad it works somehow.
