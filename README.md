YoutubeShortMaker-v2 is a tkinter app that you can simpler clone and use in your local machine. version 1 is also same but I don't recommend using that as it was missing a few things.
YoutubeShortMaker-v3 is a django webapp( still under process) that can help you create youtube shorts (of specific type), it is the web version of the tkinter app
